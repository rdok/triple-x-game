### High Specs
- Simple number puzzle game
- Hacking into a computer lock
- Need to ind a valid combination of codes
- Starts pretty easy, becomes much harder


### Scenario

You hurry up, and move into the data center room. Your heart is racing, and the 
adrenaline is racing through your veins. Some of the machines in front you have 
USB sockets. Taking out your dev machine from your backpack, it takes you a couple
of tries to plug it in; your hand is trembling from the stress. Finally, with 
your trusty Arch Linux OS, you're ready.

You start your hacking script ./hack.sh, and get into the zone:

- There are three numbers in the code
- The codes multiply to give 18
- The codes add up to 8

Enter the three code numbers followed by x


> 3 3 2 x


##### Success
You're in! You hear someone opening up the data center room door. Need to hurry 
up before they found you.

##### Failure
Your failed attempt caused the data center to alert the DevOps. They're getting
closer to find you.
